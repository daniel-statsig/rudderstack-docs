# RudderStack Airflow Provider

RudderStack's Airflow Provider lets you schedule and trigger your [**Warehouse Actions**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/) syncs from outside RudderStack and integrate them with your existing Airflow workflows.

<div class="infoBlock">

  The RudderStack Airflow Provider contains two major components:

  <ul>
  <li>**Operator**: Refers to a task to be executed when a DAG runs.</li>
  <li>**Hook**: Refers to the interface used by the Provider to connect to the external services for triggering/stopping syncs, getting the sync status, etc.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Using the RudderStack Airflow Provider

<div class="infoBlock">

To use the RudderStack Airflow Provider, you must have Apache Airflow installed locally. For more information, refer to the <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/local.html">Airflow documentation</a>.
</div>

To use the RudderStack Airflow Provider, follow the steps listed in the sections below:

### Running Airflow

Initialize all the dependencies by running Apache Airflow via the following command:

```bash
airflow standalone
```

### Installing Airflow Provider

Install the RudderStack Airflow Provider by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-airflow-provider.git
cd rudder-airflow-provider
pip3 install -e .
```

### Defining a DAG

The next step is to define a DAG with any number of tasks as per your requirement. 

The following code snippet highlights an Airflow DAG with one task named `rs_trigger_symc` for the source ID `20dQV6yuUDUw31peWA8f7xxgHdN`:

```bash
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

from airflow import DAG

from rudder_airflow_provider.operators.rudderstack import RudderstackOperator

default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'email': ['airflow@example.com'],
    'email_on_failure': False,
    'email_on_retry': False,
    'retries': 1,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5)
}

with DAG('rudderstack-sample',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='A simple tutorial DAG',
    schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),
    start_date=datetime(2021, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,
    tags=['rs']) as dag:
    rs_operator = RudderstackOperator(source_id='20dQV6yuUDUw31peWA8f7xxgHdN', connecetion_id='rudderstack_sync_conn', task_id='rs_trigger_sync')
```

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on where to find the source ID, refer to <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/#source-details">this guide</a>.
</div>

### Creating an Airflow connection

To create a new Airflow connection, follow these steps:

- Go to your Airflow dashboard and in the **Admin** tab, select **Connections**:

- Add a new connection by configuring the following details:

   - **Connection ID**: Specify a unique connection name. If you don't specify a **Connection ID**, the RudderStack operator will pick the connection with the name `rudderstack_default`.

   - **Connection Type**: For this field, select **HTTP** from the list.

   - **Host**: Set the value for this field to `https://api.rudderstack.com`.

   - **Password**: Enter your Personal Access Token here.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on where to find the personal access token, refer to <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/api-access-token/">this guide</a>.
</div>

### Running the DAG

Once you have defined a DAG and configured an Airflow connection, Airflow will automatically show the DAG in the dashboard. You can run the DAG via the following commands:

```bash
mkdir $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags
cp rudderstack_dag.py $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags
```

**Make sure the Airflow scheduler is running in the background**. Also, you must enable the DAG in the Airflow dashboard, as shown:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/airflow-provider-3.png" alt="enabling Airflow DAG in dashboard" />

<div class="successBlock">

You can trigger a DAG by clicking on the play button on the right as seen above, and selecting <strong>Trigger DAG</strong>.
