# Snowflake

\*\*\*\*[**Snowflake**](https://www.snowflake.com/) is a cloud-based data warehouse provided as Software-as-a-Service \(SaaS\). It offers all the features of a modern data warehouse, including scalability, ease of use, secure access to your data, accelerated analytics capabilities, and much more.

This guide will help you configure Snowflake as a source from which you can route event data to your desired destinations through RudderStack.

## Granting Permissions

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must have the **ACCOUNTADMIN** role in order to grant the necessary permissions.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-09-17-at-6.46.08-pm.png)

Run the following SQL queries in the **exact order** to grant the necessary permissions for the Snowflake Warehouse Actions source:

### User & role creation

* The following command creates the role `RUDDER_ROLE` in Snowflake. After creating the role, you can grant object privileges to it.

```text
CREATE ROLE RUDDER_ROLE;
```

* The following command verifies if the role `RUDDER_ROLE` is successfully created.

```text
SHOW ROLES;
```

* The following command creates a new user `RUDDER` with your password `<strong_unique_password>` in Snowflake.

```text
CREATE USER RUDDER PASSWORD = '<strong_unique_password>' DEFAULT_ROLE = 'RUDDER_ROLE';
```

* The following command verifies if the user `RUDDER` is successfully created.

```text
SHOW USERS;
```

### Creating the RudderStack schema & granting permissions

* The following command creates a dedicated schema `_RUDDERSTACK` to be used by RudderStack for storing the state of each data sync.

```text
CREATE SCHEMA "<YOUR_DATABASE>"."_RUDDERSTACK";
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `_RUDDERSTACK` schema is used by RudderStack. Its name **should not** be changed.
{% endhint %}

* The following command allows `RUDDER_ROLE` to have full access to the schema `_RUDDERSTACK`.

```text
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA "<YOUR_DATABASE>"."_RUDDERSTACK" TO ROLE RUDDER_ROLE;
```

### Granting permissions on the warehouse, database, schema & the table

* The following command enables the user \(`RUDDER`\) to perform all the operations allowed for the role `RUDDER_ROLE` \(via the access privileges granted to it\).

```text
GRANT ROLE RUDDER_ROLE TO USER RUDDER;
```

* The following command allows the role `RUDDER_ROLE` to look up the objects within the warehouse `<YOUR_WAREHOUSE>`. Replace `<YOUR_WAREHOUSE>` with the exact name of your data warehouse in Snowflake.

```text
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE "<YOUR_WAREHOUSE>" TO ROLE RUDDER_ROLE;
```

* The following command allows the role `RUDDER_ROLE` to look up objects within the database `<YOUR_DATABASE>`. Replace `<YOUR_DATABASE>` with the exact name of your database in Snowflake.

```text
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "<YOUR_DATABASE>" TO ROLE RUDDER_ROLE;
```

* The following command lets the role `RUDDER_ROLE` look up objects within the schema `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`. Replace `<YOUR_DATABASE>` and `<YOUR_SCHEMA>` with the exact name of your database and the schema in Snowflake.

```text
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<YOUR_DATABASE>"."<YOUR_SCHEMA>" TO ROLE RUDDER_ROLE;
```

* The following command allows the role `RUDDER_ROLE` to read the data from the specified table `<YOUR_TABLE>`. Replace `<YOUR_DATABASE>`, `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`, and `<YOUR_TABLE>` with the exact database, schema, and table names in Snowflake.

```text
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE "<YOUR_DATABASE>"."<YOUR_SCHEMA>"."<YOUR_TABLE>" TO ROLE  RUDDER_ROLE;
```

* The following **optional** command allows the role `RUDDER_ROLE` to read data from **all** the tables in the schema `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`:

```text
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "<YOUR_DATABASE>"."<YOUR_SCHEMA>" TO ROLE RUDDER_ROLE;
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Run the above command only if you're okay with RudderStack being able to access all the tables within your specified schema.
{% endhint %}

* The following **optional** command allows the role `<RUDDER_ROLE>` to read data from all the **future** **tables** in the schema `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`:

```text
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA "<YOUR_DATABASE>"."<YOUR_SCHEMA>" TO ROLE RUDDER_ROLE;
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Run the above command only if you're okay with RudderStack being able to access the data in all the future tables residing within your specified schema.
{% endhint %}

* The following command allows the role `RUDDER_ROLE` to read the data from the specified view `<YOUR_VIEW>`. Replace `<YOUR_DATABASE>`, `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`, and `<YOUR_VIEW>` with the exact database, schema, and view names in Snowflake.

```text
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW "<YOUR_DATABASE>"."<YOUR_SCHEMA>"."<YOUR_VIEW>" TO ROLE  RUDDER_ROLE;
```

* The following **optional** command allows the role `RUDDER_ROLE` to read data from **all** the views in the schema `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`:

```text
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "<YOUR_DATABASE>"."<YOUR_SCHEMA>" TO ROLE RUDDER_ROLE;
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Run the above command only if you're okay with RudderStack being able to access all the views within your specified schema.
{% endhint %}

* The following **optional** command allows the role `<RUDDER_ROLE>` to read data from all the **future views** in the schema `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`:

```text
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN SCHEMA "<YOUR_DATABASE>"."<YOUR_SCHEMA>" TO ROLE RUDDER_ROLE;

```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Run the above command only if you're okay with RudderStack being able to access all the future views residing within your specified schema.
{% endhint %}
