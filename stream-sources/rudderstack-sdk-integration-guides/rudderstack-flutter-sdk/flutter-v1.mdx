# Flutter SDK v1

<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to this guide if you are using the older versions of the RudderStack Flutter SDK (v1). If you're using the Flutter SDK v2, refer to <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-flutter-sdk/">this</a> guide.
</div>

## Initializing the RudderStack client

After adding the SDK as a dependency, you need to set up the SDK.

- To import the SDK, refer to the following snippet:

```dart
import 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderClient.dart';
import 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderConfig.dart';
import 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderLogger.dart';
```

- Add the following code snippet in your application:

```dart
RudderLogger.init(RudderLogger.VERBOSE);
RudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();
builder.withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL);
builder.withTrackLifecycleEvents(true);
RudderClient.getInstance(WRITE_KEY,config: builder.build());
```
## Track

You can record the users' activity through the `track` method. Every action performed by the user is called an event.

A sample `track` event is shown below:

```dart
RudderProperty property = RudderProperty();
property.put("test_key_1", "test_key_1");
RudderProperty childProperty = RudderProperty();
childProperty.put("test_child_key_1", "test_child_value_1");
property.put("test_key_2",childProperty);
RudderClient.track("test_track_event", properties: property);
```

<div class="infoBlock">

For detailed documentation on the <code class="inline-code">track</code> method and its signature, refer to <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-flutter-sdk/#track">this</a> section.
</div>

## Identify

RudderStack captures `deviceId` and uses that as the `anonymousId` for identifying the user. This helps to track the users across the application installation. To attach more information to the user, you can use the `identify` method. 

Once a user is identified, the SDK persists all the user information and passes it to the successive  `track` or `screen` calls. To reset the user identification, you can use the `reset` method.

<div class="infoBlock">

On the Android devices, the <code class="inline-code">deviceId</code> is assigned during the first boot. It remains consistent across the applications and installs. This can be changed only after a factory reset of the device.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
According to the Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor">documentation</a>, if the iOS device has multiple apps from the same vendor, all the apps will be assigned the same <code class="inline-code">deviceId</code>. If all the applications from a vendor are uninstalled and then reinstalled, then they will be assigned a new <code class="inline-code">deviceId</code>.
</div>

A sample `identify` event is as shown:

```dart
RudderTraits traits = RudderTraits();
traits.putBirthdayDate(new DateTime.now());
traits.putEmail("abc@123.com");
traits.putFirstName("First");
traits.putLastName("Last");
traits.putGender("m");
traits.putPhone("5555555555");

Address address = Address();
address.putCity("City");
address.putCountry("USA");
traits.putAddress(address);

traits.put("boolean", true);
traits.put("integer", 50);
traits.put("float", 120.4);
traits.put("long", 1234);
traits.put("string", "hello");
traits.put("date", new DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch);

RudderClient.identify("test_user_id", traits: traits, options: null);
```

<div class="infoBlock">

For detailed documentation on the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> method and its signature, refer to <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-flutter-sdk/#identify">this</a> section.
</div>

## Screen

You can use the `screen` call to record whenever the user views a screen on their mobile device. You can also send some extra properties along with this event.

A sample `screen` event is as shown:

```dart
RudderProperty screenProperty = new RudderProperty();
screenProperty.put("foo", "bar");
RudderClient.screen("Main Activity",
    properties: screenProperty, options: null);
```

<div class="infoBlock">

For detailed documentation on the <code class="inline-code">screen</code> method and its signature, refer to <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-flutter-sdk/#screen">this</a> section.
</div>

## Group

The `group` call associates a user to a specific organization.

A sample `group` event is shown below:

```dart
RudderTraits groupTraits = RudderTraits();
groupTraits.put("foo", "bar");
groupTraits.put("foo1", "bar1");
RudderClient.group("sample_group_id",
    groupTraits: groupTraits, options: null);
```

<div class="infoBlock">

For detailed documentation on the <code class="inline-code">group</code> method and its signature, refer to <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-flutter-sdk/#group">this</a> section.
</div>

## Alias

The `alias` call lets you merge different identities of a known user.

<div class="infoBlock">

<code class="inline-code">alias</code> is an advanced method that lets you change the tracked user's ID explicitly. This method is useful when managing identities for some of the downstream destinations.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

For a detailed explanation of the <code class="inline-code">alias</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/alias/">RudderStack API Specification</a> guide.
</div>

A sample `alias` call is as shown:

```dart
RudderClient.alias("new_user_id", options: null);
```

<div class="infoBlock">

For detailed documentation on the <code class="inline-code">alias</code> method and its signature, refer to <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-flutter-sdk/#alias">this</a> section.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack replaces the old <code class="inline-code">userId</code> with the <code class="inline-code">newUserId</code> and persists this identification across the sessions.
</div>

## Reset

You can use the `reset` method to clear the persisted `traits` for the `identify` call. This is required for scenarios where the user logs out of a session.

```dart
RudderClient.reset();
```

## External ID

You can pass your custom `userId` along with standard `userId` in your `identify` calls. RudderStack adds those values under `context.externalId`. 

The following code snippet highlights how to add `externalId` to your `identify` event:

```dart
RudderOption option = RudderOption();
option.putExternalId("externalId", "some_external_id_1");
RudderClient.identify("testUserId", options: option);
```

## Anonymous ID

By default, RudderStack uses `deviceId` as `anonymousId`. You can use the following method to override and set your own `anonymousId` with the SDK:

```dart
RudderClient.putAnonymousId(<ANONYMOUS_ID>);
```

## Advertising ID

You can use the `putAdvertisingId` method to pass your Android and iOS AAID and IDFA respectively. The `putAdvertisingId` method accepts a string argument as described below:

- `id` : Your Android `advertisingId` \(AAID\) \(or\) your iOS `advertisingId` \(IDFA\).

An example of how to use `putAdvertisingId` is as shown:

```dart
RudderClient.putAdvertisingId(<ADVERTISING_ID>);
```

<div class="infoBlock">

  The <code class="inline-code">id</code> parameter that you pass in the <code class="inline-code">putAdvertisingId</code> method is assigned as the AAID if you are on an Android device, and as the IDFA if you are on an iOS device.
</div>

## Setting the device token

You can pass your device token for push notifications to be passed to the destinations which support the Push Notification feature. RudderStack sets the token under `context.device.token`.

An example of setting the device token is as shown below:

```dart
RudderClient.putDeviceToken(<DEVICE_TOKEN>);
```

## Debugging

If you run into any issues regarding the Flutter SDK, you can turn on the `VERBOSE` or `DEBUG` logging to determine the issue. To do so, follow these steps:

- First, make sure you import `RudderLogger` by running the following command:

```dart
import 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderLogger.dart';
```

- Then, to turn on the logging, change your `rudderClient` initialization to the following:

```dart
RudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();
builder.withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL);
builder.withLogLevel(RudderLogger.VERBOSE);
RudderClient.getInstance(WRITE_KEY,
                          config: builder.build());
```

- You can set the log level to one of the following values:

1. `NONE`
2. `ERROR`
3. `WARN`
4. `INFO`
5. `DEBUG`
6. `VERBOSE`

## FAQs

### How do I get the user `traits` after making an `identify` call?

You can get the user traits after making an `identify` call in the following way:

```dart
Map context = await RudderClient.getRudderContext();
print(context["traits"]);
```
