## Initializing the RudderStack Client

After adding the SDK as a dependency, you need to set up the SDK.

- Make sure to import the SDK wherever you use it with:

```dart
import 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderClient.dart';
import 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderConfig.dart';
import 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderLogger.dart';
```

- Add the following code somewhere in your application.

```dart
RudderLogger.init(RudderLogger.VERBOSE);
RudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();
builder.withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL);
builder.withTrackLifecycleEvents(true);
RudderClient.getInstance(WRITE_KEY,config: builder.build());
```
## Track

You can record the users' activity through the `track` method. Every action performed by the user is called an event.

An example of the `track` event is as shown:

```dart
RudderProperty property = RudderProperty();
property.put("test_key_1", "test_key_1");
RudderProperty childProperty = RudderProperty();
childProperty.put("test_child_key_1", "test_child_value_1");
property.put("test_key_2",childProperty);
RudderClient.track("test_track_event", properties: property);
```

## Identify

We capture `deviceId` and use that as the `anonymousId` for identifying the user. It helps to track the users across the application installation. To attach more information to the user, you can use the `identify` method.

Once you set the `identify` information to the user, it will also be passed to the successive `track` or `screen` calls. To reset the user identification, you can use the `reset` method.

<div class="infoBlock">

On the Android devices, the <code class="inline-code">deviceId</code> is assigned during the first boot. It remains consistent across the applications and installs. It changes only after factory reset.

</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
On the iOS devices, According to the Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor">documentation</a>, if the device has multiple apps from the same vendors, all those apps will be assigned the same <code class="inline-code">deviceId</code>. If all the applications from a vendor are uninstalled, then on next install the app will be assigned a new <code class="inline-code">deviceId</code>.
</div>

An example `identify` event is as shown:

```dart
RudderTraits traits = RudderTraits();
traits.putBirthdayDate(new DateTime.now());
traits.putEmail("abc@123.com");
traits.putFirstName("First");
traits.putLastName("Last");
traits.putGender("m");
traits.putPhone("5555555555");

Address address = Address();
address.putCity("City");
address.putCountry("USA");
traits.putAddress(address);

traits.put("boolean", true);
traits.put("integer", 50);
traits.put("float", 120.4);
traits.put("long", 1234);
traits.put("string", "hello");
traits.put("date", new DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch);

RudderClient.identify("test_user_id", traits: traits, options: null);
```

## Screen

You can use the `screen` call to record whenever the user sees a screen on the mobile device. You can also send some extra properties along with this event.

An example of the `screen` event is as shown:

```dart
RudderProperty screenProperty = new RudderProperty();
screenProperty.put("foo", "bar");
RudderClient.screen("Main Activity",
    properties: screenProperty, options: null);
```

## Group

The `group` call associates a user to a specific organization.

An example of `group` event is as shown:

```dart
RudderTraits groupTraits = RudderTraits();
groupTraits.put("foo", "bar");
groupTraits.put("foo1", "bar1");
RudderClient.group("sample_group_id",
    groupTraits: groupTraits, options: null);
```

## Alias

The `alias` call associates the user with a new identification.

An example of `alias` event is as shown:

```dart
RudderClient.alias("new_user_id", options: null);
```

The `alias` method has the following signature:

| Name      | Data Type      | Required | Description                                          |
| :-------- | :------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| `newId`   | `String`       | Yes      | The new `userId` you want to assign to the user      |
| `options` | `RudderOption` | No       | Extra options to be passed along with `alias` event. |

We replace the old `userId` with the `newUserId` and we persist that identification across the sessions.

## Reset

You can use the `reset` method to clear the persisted `traits` for the `identify` call. This is required for `Logout` operations.

```dart
RudderClient.reset();
```

## External ID

You can pass your custom `userId` along with standard `userId` in your `identify` calls. We add those values under `context.externalId`. The following code snippet shows a way to add `externalId` to your `identify` request.

```dart
RudderOption option = RudderOption();
option.putExternalId("externalId", "some_external_id_1");
RudderClient.identify("testUserId", options: option);
```

## Anonymous ID

We use the `deviceId` as `anonymousId` by default. You can use the following method to override and use your own `anonymousId` with the SDK.

<div class="warningBlock">

You need to call <code class="inline-code">setAnonymousId</code> method before calling <code class="inline-code">getInstance</code>

</div>

An example of setting the `anonymousId` is as below

```dart
RudderClient.setAnonymousId(<ANONYMOUS_ID>);
```

## Advertising ID

You can use the `setAdvertisingId` method to pass your Android and iOS AAID and IDFA respectively. The `setAdvertisingId` method accepts a `string` argument :

- `id` : Your Android `advertisingId` \(AAID\) \(or\) Your iOS `advertisingId` \(IDFA\)

<div class="warningBlock">

On `Android` device you need to call <code class="inline-code">setAdvertisingId</code> method before calling <code class="inline-code">getInstance</code>

</div>

An example of how to use `setAdvertisingId` is as shown:

```dart
RudderClient.setAdvertisingId(<ADVERTISING_ID>);
```

<div class="infoBlock">

The <code class="inline-code">id</code> parameter you pass to the above method is assigned as <code class="inline-code">AAID</code> if you are on <code class="inline-code">android</code> device and as <code class="inline-code">IDFA</code> if you are on a <code class="inline-code">iOS</code> device.

</div>

## Setting Device Token

You can pass your `device-token` for push notifications to be passed to the destinations which support the Push Notification feature. We set the `token` under `context.device.token`.

An example of setting the `device-token` is as below:

```dart
RudderClient.putDeviceToken(<DEVICE_TOKEN>);
```

## Debugging

If you run into any issues regarding the RudderStack Flutter SDK, you can turn on the `VERBOSE` or `DEBUG` logging to find out what the issue is.

First, make sure you import `RudderLogger` with the below command:

```dart
import 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderLogger.dart';
```

Then to turn on the logging, change your `RudderClient` initialization to the following:

```dart
RudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();
builder.withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL);
builder.withLogLevel(RudderLogger.VERBOSE);
RudderClient.getInstance(WRITE_KEY,
                          config: builder.build());
```

You can set the log level to one of the following values:

1. `NONE`
2. `ERROR`
3. `WARN`
4. `INFO`
5. `DEBUG`
6. `VERBOSE`

## FAQs

### How do I get the user `traits` after making an `identify` call?

You can get the user traits after making an `identify` call in the following way:

```dart
Map context = await RudderClient.getRudderContext();
print(context["traits"]);
```
